Many thanks to [Istvan Chung's](http://www.impredicative.com/pipermail/ur/2015-August/002165.html) [Pull Request](https://github.com/StefanScott/urweb-pikaday/pull/1). The Pull Request has now been merged, correcting the previous errors in my Ur/Web (and JavaScript) code, and getting this to work.

(PS - In my testing, I compiled this *without* using the Makefile provided by Istvan, since I was unsure how to use it.)
